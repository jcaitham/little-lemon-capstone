# React Certificate Capstone project

This is my capstone project for Meta's React Front-End Developer course/certificate, offered through Coursera.  It is a partial front-end for a fictional restaurant called Little Lemon.  Theming, images, and design were mostly provided or at least inspired by the course materials, but the code itself was done entirely by hand.  

Most of the content is just fairly simple HTML/CSS, done in React, but there is also 

 - Form validation and custom form elements
 - Simple front-end controls, such as a slideshow-esque tool
 - Responsive design, especially for the header & footer
 - Accessibility
 - Simple unit testing for the reservations form
 
I enjoyed learning about React's useNavigate hook and how you can use it to transfer state to a new page, as well as the CSS object-fit property, which I had somehow never used before.  

To run the page, you should use `git clone`, then run `npm install`, followed by `npm start`.  This should automatically launch you to `localhost:3000`, where you can view the webpage.  Or you can just go to [https://little-lemon.twoplustwoequalsfish.com](https://little-lemon.twoplustwoequalsfish.com).
 



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
